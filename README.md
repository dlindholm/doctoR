# Tools for medical research - The doctoR package

This package contains several functions that I've created when faced with repetitive
tasks in data analysis. The focus is medical research, since that's my field, but
some of the functions could probably be used in other areas as well.

The package is under development. New functions will certainly be added, and the
existing ones may be further optimized.

It adds functionality for forest plots, flowcharts, handling of variable labels, etc.
